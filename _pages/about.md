Hi! My name is Orest Tokovenko. I'm 25 years old and currently work as a Data Analyst for the Exempt Edge FinTech division at Olympia Financial Group Inc. I was raised in Burlington, Ontario and am currently based in Calgary, Alberta.

My hobbies include languages, making good quality coffee, trivia, photography, mixology, and notaphily, but the list will likely increase as I love learning new things!

I strongly believe that the best way to learn and understand a new skill is by taking a hands-on approach with just enough theory to explain the concepts and a big dose of practice to be ready for a production environment.

### Data Science, Analytics and Engineering

I discovered Data Science in mid-2019 when I realized business intelligence work I had been doing at UPS for two years as a Branch Manager was part of an exciting new field called Data Science. Eventually, I left my job to pursue a Data Science diploma at BrainStation and soon after graduating, I found work in Calgary. I am currently working on completing a university certificate in Big Data Programming and Architecture(see 'Data Engineering'). I also obtained a few certifications for Big Data technologies such as Apache Airflow, as well as Cloud Computing like AWS and Azure. I love to keep up with the latest trends so in January I decided to enroll in the  [DataClub.Talks data engineering zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp), which allowed me to see data engineering from a production level perspective and try new technologies, such as Terraform, Kafka, and BigQuery.

### Languages

Growing up in a bilingual household I always appreciated languages. When I was 16, one of my now closest friends and I went to do a Mandarin Chinese class on the weekends. Although I failed to learn Chinese, I now speak 8 languages in varying degrees of fluency, which includes English, Ukrainian, French, German, Spanish, Portguese, Turkish and Russian. I intend to stop at 10 once I learn Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic (either the Levantine or the Egyptian dialect). If you're curious how I manage to learn these languages, I documented my method which you can access [here](https://github.com/oresttokovenko/Guide-How-I-Learn-Languages). I decided to join HYPIA because I wanted to be a formal member of the hyperpolyglot community, after being a frequent visitor of Toronto Babel, Mundo Lingo Toronto, and Toronto Couch Surfing. I applied and was accepted in February 2021.
