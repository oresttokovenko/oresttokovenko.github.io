Hi! My name is Orest Tokovenko. I'm 26 years old Data Engineer. I was raised in Burlington, Ontario and am currently based in Calgary, Alberta.

My journey into data engineering began during my studies at BrainStation where I specialized in Data Science. I was always fascinated by the power of data and its potential to make a real-world impact. During my time at BrainStation, I had the opportunity to work on a number of data-driven projects, including building a neural network to generate realistic text and working with GPT-3 (beta at the time) as my capstone project.

After graduation, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in the data space, so I started working as a Data Analyst at a publicly traded financial firm, specifically in information technology services for exempt market dealers, registrants, and issuers. It was a great experience, but I quickly realized that I wanted to dive deeper into the world of data engineering. So, I decided to take the plunge and transitioned into a Data Engineering role at Fullscript.

At Fullscript, I work on building and maintaining our data infrastructure. This includes everything from designing and implementing ELT pipelines to managing our databases and data warehouses. One of my favorite projects has been optimized SQL queries running complex joins between multiple tables using best practices and materialization schedules in dbt. It's been challenging, but incredibly rewarding to see the impact it's had on our business.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking in the Rocky Mountains, strength training, and experimenting with new Data Engineering technologies (I'm particularly interested in MLOps and scalable/distributed systems). I'm also an avid reader and enjoy learning about different topics, from history to philosophy.

I believe that my hands-on approach to learning, coupled with my passion for data and technology, has been key to my success as a Data Engineer. I'm excited to continue growing my skills and making a real-world impact through data.
