Hi! My name is Orest Tokovenko. I was raised in Burlington, Ontario and currently reside in Calgary, Alberta. I'm 25 years old and currently work as a Data Analyst for the Exempt Edge FinTech division of Olympia Financial Group Inc.

My hobbies include languages, making good quality coffee, trivia, photography, mixology, and notaphily, but the list will likely increase as I love learning new things!

I strongly believe that the best way to learn and understand a new skill is by taking a hands-on approach with just enough theory to explain the concepts and a big dose of practice to be ready for a production environment.

### Data Science, Analytics and Engineering

I discovered Data Science in mid-2019 when I realized the work I had been doing at UPS for two years as a Business Analyst, was part of an exciting new field called Data Science. Eventually, I left my job to pursue a Data Science diploma at BrainStation and soon after I graduated found work in Calgary. From there I went back to my alta mater to complete a university certificate in Big Data Programming and Architecture(see 'Data Engineering')

### Languages

Growing up in a bilingual household I always appreciated languages. When I was 16 I met of my now cloests friends, and we went to do a Mandarin Chinese class on the weekends, which counted towards my high school credits. I failed to learn Chinese, but at the moment I speak 8 languages in varying degrees of fluency, which include English, Ukrainian, French, German, Spanish, Portguese, Turkish and Russian. I intedned to stop at 10 once I learn Mandarin Chinese (finally), and Arabic(either the Levantine or the Egyptian dialect) You can access my method [here](https://github.com/oresttokovenko/Guide-How-I-Learn-Languages). I decided to join HYPIA because I wanted to be a formal member of the hyperpolyglot community. I applied and was accepted in February 2021. Below is a video of me interviewing the Founder of HYPIA
