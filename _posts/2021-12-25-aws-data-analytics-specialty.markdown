### _Study Guide_

### Collection
* #### Determine the operational characteristics of the collection system
  * **Fault Tolerance and Data Persistence**
    * The Kinesis Producer library can send a group of multiple records in each request
      * If a record fails, it's put back into the KPL buffer for a retry
      * One record's failure doesn't fail a whole set of records
