This study guide covers the Astronomer Certification DAG Authoring for Apache Airflow. Apache Airflow is the leading orchestrator for authoring, scheduling, and monitoring data pipelines. The exam consists of 75 questions, and you have 60 minutes to write it. The study guide below covers everything you need to know for it. The exam includes scenarios (both text and images of Python code) where you need to determine the best course of action.

According to Astronomer, this exam will test the following:

"You have to show your capabilities of understanding the different features that Airflow brings to create DAGs. What are the pros and cons of each one as well as their limitations. You should be comfortable for recommending settings and design choices for data pipelines according to different use cases. You should know the most common operators as well as the specificities of others allowing  to define DAG dependencies, choose different branches, wait for events and so on"
